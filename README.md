# Hey there, I'm Max & you've found an Easter Egg! This text does not display on GitHub's README, only if you view the RAW source ;)  

I'm assuming you're here trying to figure out the secret to how I added this README to my profile, or how I added the animation to my profile.

## How did I add the README to my GitHub page?
- It's super simple. Go create a new repository and name it identical to your GitHub username and click the "Add README.md" button. After that you can edit the README directly in your browser or clone the repo and edit in your favorite IDE. 

## Are you trying to figure out how I did the animation on my profile?
- Here is the pen I (sloppily) threw together https://codepen.io/maxshuty/pen/NWpWGpj by combining a couple other pens to create the animation, then I simply used a screencapture tool to convert it to a gif (pronounced jiff, but we can fight about that later). Finally I uploaded the file to my maxshuty/maxshuty repo where this README resides. The implementation is simple enough below.

I am a software developer with a passion for accessibility & frontend development using technologies like Vue/Vuex & React/Redux.

I believe that we should be designing with accessibility at the top of our minds to ensure we are creating an accessible web to create an equal experience for everyone. I enjoy helping answer other developers questions on StackOverflow, like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons. Occasionally I [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67356599/the-deep-selector-is-not-working-using-sass-loader-in-my-vuejs-application) my own questions or try to find [better solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730116/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-with-vue-js/57661780#57661780) to old problems.
