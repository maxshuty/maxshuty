![Hey there, I'm Max. Tinkerer. Creator. Dad joke teller. Accessibility matters. Checkout my work below...](https://github.com/maxshuty/maxshuty/blob/main/maxs-profile-animation.gif)

I am a software developer with a passion for accessibility & frontend development using technologies like Vue/Vuex & React/Redux.

I believe that we should be designing with accessibility at the top of our minds to ensure we are creating an accessible web to create an equal experience for everyone. I enjoy helping answer other developers questions on StackOverflow, like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons. Occasionally I [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67356599/the-deep-selector-is-not-working-using-sass-loader-in-my-vuejs-application) my own questions or try to find [better solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730116/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-with-vue-js/57661780#57661780) to old problems.

Author of [SimplyLazy](https://github.com/maxshuty/simply-lazy), a simple, lightweight (0.6kb), easy to use pure JavaScript image lazy loader that even works in IE utilizing the `IntersectionObserver` API.
