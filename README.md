# Hey! You've found an Easter Egg, this text only displays if you view the RAW source :)
- Want to know how I added this README to my profile, or how I added the animation to my profile... search no more!

## Want to add a README like this to your profile page?
- It's super simple. All you need to do is create a new repository and name it identical to your GitHub username and click the "Add README.md" button. Now you can edit the README directly in your browser or clone the repo and edit in your favorite IDE. 

## Want to know how I did the animation on my profile?
- Here is a pen I threw together https://codepen.io/maxshuty/pen/NWpWGpj by combining a couple other pens from other awesome developers to create the animation. Then I used a screen capture tool to convert it to a gif (pronounced jiff, but we can fight about that later). Finally I uploaded the file to my `maxshuty/maxshuty` repo where this README resides. The implementation is simple enough below.

## Contact me
- If you would like to contact me you can reach me at my first name (Max) plus my last name (Poshusta) at Googles email domain.

![Hey there, I'm Max. Tinkerer. Creator. Dad joke teller. Accessibility matters. Checkout my work below...](https://github.com/maxshuty/maxshuty/blob/main/maxs-profile-animation.gif)

I am a software developer with full stack experience & a passion for creating accessibile UI's & frontend development using technologies like Vue/Vuex & React/Redux.

### Find me on the Web ðŸŒŽ :
- See what I've been up to lately on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxposhusta)
- Checkout my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4826740/maxshuty) profile to see what technology I've been geeking out over


### Passionate about:
- â™¿ Accessibility, I believe that we should be designing with accessibility at the top of our minds to ensure we are creating an equal experience for everyone
- ðŸ¤“ Frontend development utilizing great technology like VueJS and ReactJS
- ðŸ§™ Solving exciting problems without a straightforward solution

I enjoy helping answer questions on StackOverflow. I believe in quality over quantity, having reached over **2.6 million** people in just over 100 answers like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons that I wrote. Sometimes I find myself [answering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67356599/the-deep-selector-is-not-working-using-sass-loader-in-my-vuejs-application) my own questions or trying to find [better solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730116/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-with-vue-js/57661780#57661780) to age-old problems.

When learning something new I enjoy diving in and applying my new found knowledge. This is what lead me to develop [**SimplyLazy**](https://github.com/maxshuty/simply-lazy) in order to learn more about the `IntersectionObserver` API. It's a simple, lightweight (0.6kb), pure JavaScript image lazy loader that even works in IE (with a simple polyfil) and even has a few handy callbacks!
