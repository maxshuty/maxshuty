# You've found an Easter Egg! This text only displays if you view the RAW source ;)  
- I'm assuming you're trying to figure out how I added this README to my profile, or how I added the animation to my profile.

## How did I add the README to my GitHub page?
- It's super simple. Go create a new repository and name it identical to your GitHub username and click the "Add README.md" button. Now you can edit the README directly in your browser or clone the repo and edit in your favorite IDE. 

## Want to know how I did the animation on my profile?
- Here is a pen I quickly threw together https://codepen.io/maxshuty/pen/NWpWGpj by combining a couple other pens to create the animation. Then I used a screencapture tool to convert it to a gif (pronounced jiff, but we can fight about that later). Finally I uploaded the file to my `maxshuty/maxshuty` repo where this README resides. The implementation is simple enough below.

## Contact me
- If you would like to contact me you can reach me at my first name (Max) plus my last name (Poshusta) at Googles email domain.

![Hey there, I'm Max. Tinkerer. Creator. Dad joke teller. Accessibility matters. Checkout my work below...](https://github.com/maxshuty/maxshuty/blob/main/maxs-profile-animation.gif)

I am a software developer with full stack experience & a passion for following accessibility standards & frontend development using technologies like Vue/Vuex & React/Redux.

### Find me on the Web ðŸŒŽ :
- See what I've been up to lately on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxposhusta)
- Checkout my [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4826740/maxshuty) profile to see what technology I've been geeking out over


### Passionate about:
- Accessibility
- Frontend development utilizing great technology like VueJS and ReactJS
I believe that we should be designing with accessibility at the top of our minds to ensure we are creating an accessible web to create an equal experience for everyone. 

I enjoy helping answer questions on StackOverflow like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons that I wrote. I also find myself [answering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67356599/the-deep-selector-is-not-working-using-sass-loader-in-my-vuejs-application) my own questions or trying to find [better solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730116/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-with-vue-js/57661780#57661780) to age-old problems.

When learning something new I enjoy diving in and trying to apply my new found knowledge. This is what lead me to develop [**SimplyLazy**](https://github.com/maxshuty/simply-lazy) in order to learn more about the `IntersectionObserver` API. It's a simple, lightweight (0.6kb), pure JavaScript image lazy loader that even works in IE (with a polyfil) and even has a few handy callbacks!
