### Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Max

I am a software developer with a passion for frontend development using technologies like Vue/Vuex & React/Redux.

Most of all I believe that we should be designing with accessibility at the top of our mindss to ensure we are creating an accessible web to create an equal experience for everyone. You can often find me helping answer othe developers questions on StackOverflow, like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons.

Author of [SimplyLazy](https://github.com/maxshuty/simply-lazy), a simple, lightweight (0.6kb), easy to use pure JavaScript image lazy loader that even works in IE utilizing the `IntersectionObserver` API.
