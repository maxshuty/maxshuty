# Hey there! You've found an Easter Egg, this message only displays if you view the RAW source of this README :)
- Want to know how I added this README to my GitHub profile? Or how I added the animation to my profile? Search no more, here are all of my biggest secrets!

## Want to add a README like this one to your profile page?
- It's super simple. All you need to do is create a new repository and name it identical to your GitHub username. Then click the "Add README.md" button. Now you can edit the README directly in your browser. Alternatively you can clone the repo and edit it in your favorite IDE. 

## Want to know how I did the .gif animation on my profile?
- Here is a code pen I threw together https://codepen.io/maxshuty/pen/NWpWGpj by combining two other pens from some awesome developers to create the animation. Then I used a screen capture tool to convert it to a .gif (pronounced jiff, but we can fight about that later). Finally I uploaded the file to my `maxshuty/maxshuty` repo where this README resides. The implementation is simple enough below.

## Contact me
- If you would like to contact me you can reach me via email at my first name (Max) plus my last name (Poshusta) at Googles email domain (period or not between the names, either one works).

I enjoy answering questions on StackOverflow & there I believe in quality over quantity. Having reached over **2.7 million** people in just over 100 answers like [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58570835/4826740) to pure CSS accessible checkboxes and radio buttons that I wrote. Sometimes I find myself [answering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67356599/the-deep-selector-is-not-working-using-sass-loader-in-my-vuejs-application) my own questions or trying to find [better solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40730116/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-with-vue-js/57661780#57661780) to age-old problems.

When learning something new I enjoy diving in and applying my new found knowledge. This is what lead me to develop a lazy loader called [**SimplyLazy**](https://github.com/maxshuty/simply-lazy) to learn more about the `IntersectionObserver` API. It's a simple, lightweight (0.6kb), pure JavaScript image lazy loader that even works in IE* (_*with a simple polyfil_) and even has a few handy callbacks!
